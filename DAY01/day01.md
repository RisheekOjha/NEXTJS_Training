# What is NextJS

Next.js is a React-based web framework created by Vercel that makes it easier to build full-stack web applications. It adds powerful features on top of React, like:

API routes
Image optimization
Server-side rendering (SSR)
Static site generation (SSG)
SEO friendly
Routing and code splitting
Built-in TypeScript support

# How Does Search Engines find a website when seached 

# Web Crawling
Search engines use bots (called crawlers or spiders) to go through the internet and visit websites.

While deploying your website on platforms like Vercel or Render makes it publicly accessible on the internet, Google's web crawler will not automatically start crawling your site the very instant you visit it for the first time.
There are three main ways Google discovers new sites:

A. Manual Submission (Highly Recommended)
You go to Google Search Console and: 
1) Add your website
Optional:Create an XML sitemap of your website and submit it through Google Search Console. This is the most effective way to tell Google about all the important pages on your site.
2) Request indexing


B. Backlinks from Other Sites

Google's primary way of discovering new websites and pages is by following links from existing websites that it has already crawled. If your site is brand new and no other indexed website links to it, Google has no direct path to find it.

C. Public Discovery Over Time

# After Crawling

After Googlebot crawls a webpage, it carefully analyzes and understands the content by parsing the HTML, extracting main text, titles, headings, metadata, and media like images and videos. For dynamic or JavaScript-heavy sites, Google renders the page as a browser would to see the full content. It also follows links on the page to discover more content. The extracted information is then processed and stored in Google's vast index, which functions like a giant library of web pages. During this process, Google filters out repetitive elements like navigation menus and normalizes content by handling word variations and detecting language. 

When a user performs a search, Google matches the query against this index and ranks pages based on many factors including relevance to the query, content quality, site authority (backlinks), user experience (speed, mobile-friendliness), freshness, location, personalization, and security (HTTPS). The most relevant and trustworthy pages are displayed in order, complete with titles, URLs, and snippets to help users find the best results quickly.

Google ranks pages differently for every search query before showing results.

# How to decide what texts to show up when searched 

Here‚Äôs how Google decides what text to show there:
Meta Description Tag (If Provided by You):
When you build your website, you can add a special tag in the HTML called <meta name="description" content="...">.
This is a short summary you write about the page, like:

<meta name="description" content="SmartGEN model is a smart and simple AI developed by OpenAI to assist with conversations." />

If you provide this, Google often uses it as the snippet under your page title in search results.

Google‚Äôs Auto-Generated Snippet (If No Meta Description or It‚Äôs Not Perfect):
If you don‚Äôt provide a meta description or Google thinks it can do better, it scans your page content and extracts a snippet that best matches the user‚Äôs search query.
For example, if you search "SmartGen", Google will pick text from your page that contains those keywords and shows it as the snippet.

Even if two sites are indexed and have similar content, the site that best satisfies Google‚Äôs ranking factors will appear higher.


# What was the problem with React
When Googlebot or other crawlers visit the react based website ,it initially gets mostly empty HTML page because React builds the UI dynamically on the client side.

Since the initial HTML has little content, search engines must wait for JavaScript to execute and render the page fully before seeing the actual content.
This can slow down indexing or cause incomplete crawling if the crawler can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt wait.

# How does Next solves a problem
Next.js extends React by adding Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG).

# Server-Side Rendering (SSR):
How it Works:
For each request to a page, Next.js executes your React components on the server. This generates the complete HTML for that page, including the data and content. This fully rendered HTML is then sent to the user's browser. The browser can immediately display the content, and React then "hydrates" the page, making it interactive.
Hydration here means React attaching JS behavior to already-rendered HTML from the server.

SEO Benefit: Search engine crawlers receive fully rendered HTML right away. This means they can instantly parse the content, follow links, and understand the page structure without having to execute JavaScript. This leads to faster and more reliable indexing.

# Static Site generation
During deployment (like when using Vercel) it runs a build process, Next.js reads your page components and also runs any code inside getStaticProps(). This is where you can make API calls ‚Äî to fetch data from a CMS, database, or external service. That data is then used to generate complete HTML pages, which are saved and served directly from a CDN. As a result, users get super-fast page loads, and search engines can crawl fully rendered content right away, which is great for SEO. SSG works best for websites where the content doesn‚Äôt change frequently, like blogs, portfolios, or product landing page



# "use client" mean in Next.js?
In Next.js App Router, files by default are treated as server components ‚Äî they run on the server.

When you want a component to run on the client side (in the browser) ‚Äî for things like interactivity, state, event listeners ‚Äî you need to tell Next.js explicitly.

That‚Äôs where "use client" comes in.

‚úÖ "use client" is a directive
It goes at the very top of your component file like this:

"use client";

import { useState } from "react";

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>;
}

üöÄ What it does:

It tells Next.js:

‚ÄúHey! This component must be rendered in the browser, not on the server.‚Äù

üîç When do you need "use client"?
Use it when your component:
Uses React state (useState, useReducer)
Uses effects (useEffect)
Listens to events (like onClick, onChange)
Interacts with the browser (like localStorage, window, document)
Needs real-time updates (e.g. websockets)

üõë When you don‚Äôt need it:
If the component is:
Just displaying static content
Rendering HTML from props
Fetching data on the server
Not using state or browser APIs


# What Is Dynamic Routing in Next.js?
Dynamic routing lets you create routes that respond to variable parts of the URL. For example:
/products/[id] can match /products/1, /products/abc123, etc.

# Metadata
When you define and export metadata inside a layout file (like your app/layout.tsx or app/layout.js), Next.js automatically reads and applies it to your pages at build time or server render ‚Äî you do not need to manually import or use it anywhere else.

# not found tsx
a user goes to /something/that/doe snt/exist, Next.js checks your routes, finds nothing, and renders not-found.tsx if it exists.

# layout.tsx
In Next.js 13+ with the App Router, layout.tsx files must have a default export that returns a valid React component

# Why clicking an <a> tag causes a full page refresh
üî¥ Problem:
When you use a regular HTML <a href="/about">About</a>, the browser:

Treats it like a classic navigation
Sends a full request to the server
Refreshes the whole page to load the new content


#  Use Next.js <Link>

import Link from 'next/link';
<Link href="/about">About</Link>

This tells Next.js: "Handle this link with client-side routing"
No page refresh
Super fast, and it can even preload pages

# Importing an image in Next.js
when importing an image in next  it gives you a structured object like:
{
  src: "/_next/static/media/white-tiger.abc123.png", // full optimized path
  width: 800,   // actual dimensions of the image
  height: 600,
  blurDataURL: "data:image/jpeg;base64,...", // tiny blur preview (optional)
  ...
}

# blurdata URL 
blurDataURL is a tiny, base64-encoded version of your image ‚Äî usually super low-res (like 10√ó10 pixels). It‚Äôs visually blurry and meant to be a placeholder until the real image fully load


# Why using Image
Automatic Optimization: It resizes, optimizes, and compresses images automatically for faster loading.
Lazy Loading: Images load only when they‚Äôre about to enter the viewport, saving bandwidth.
Responsive: Serves the best image size for different devices, reducing unnecessary load.
Built-in Placeholders: Supports features like blurDataURL to display a smooth, blurred placeholder until the image is fully loaded.


# Remote images in Next.js
By default, Next.js blocks remote images unless you explicitly allow the domain when showing image using <Image>.
You must edit your next.config.js like this

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  images:{
    remotePatterns:[
      {
        protocol:"https",
        hostname:"images.unsplash.com"
      }
    ]
  }
}; 


# Slug
A slug is the part of a web address (URL) that comes after the domain name and shows what the page is about ‚Äî usually a few words joined by hyphens.

ex: example.com/my-cool-article
here, my-cool-article is the slug.

# Key Takeaways About Slugs & Dynamic Routes in Next.js

1. **Dynamic Routes Use Bracket Syntax:**
   - Folder names like `[slug]` define dynamic segments.
   - The name inside brackets becomes the key in the `params` object.

2. **`params` Object Is Passed Automatically:**
   - Next.js provides the dynamic parts of the URL as `params` to your page/layout components.
   - Access it via `params.slug` if your folder is `[slug]`.

3. **Folder Name Must Match `params` Key Exactly:**
   - If folder is `[course_slug]`, use `params.course_slug`.
   - Avoid hyphens in folder names to prevent confusion (use underscores or camelCase).

4. **Pages Using Dynamic Params Are `async` by Default:**
   - Your page component should be marked `async`.
   - Await `params` properly before using them (in Next.js 13+).

5. **Slugs Represent URL-friendly Identifiers:**
   - Slugs are URL parts representing resources (e.g., blog posts, courses).
   - They‚Äôre usually lowercase, no spaces, often hyphenated (e.g., `my-first-post`).

6. **Use Slugs to Build SEO-friendly URLs:**
   - Instead of query params like `/course?id=123`, slugs give `/course/react-hooks`.
   - Cleaner URLs improve user experience and SEO.

7. **You Can Transform Slugs Easily:**
   - Use JS string methods like `.toUpperCase()`, `.replace()`, or `.split()` to format slugs in your UI.

8. **Restart Dev Server After Renaming Dynamic Folders:**
   - Next.js sometimes caches routing info; restarting ensures changes apply.

## The parent layout applies to all nested pages unless overridden by a child layout.

##  You can't use hooks like useState or useEffect inside an async function.
